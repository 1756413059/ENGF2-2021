2
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,119
welcome back everybody

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,160
so in this video i'm going to talk just

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,920
a little bit about

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,439
algorithms now what exactly is an

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,800
algorithm

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,960
an algorithm is a sequence of steps

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
that you can take that lead to a

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
solution of

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,719
typically a computational problem and

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,719
whether you know it or not you're

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,000
already familiar with quite a number of

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,480
algorithms from maths

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,320
you know for example how to perform long

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,280
multiplication and long division with a

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
pencil and paper

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
that's an algorithm you know how to find

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
the roots of a quadratic equation of the

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
form

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,199
uh ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,480
that's an algorithm you know how to

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,840
expand brackets

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,600
and things like that those are all

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,520
algorithms that you would be used to

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,320
applying from maths

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,320
now beyond math we find algorithms all

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,640
sorts of places in the wider world

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,439
in form of information algorithms that

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,360
solve

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,479
more interesting tasks like maybe

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,280
rendering a

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,080
3d image in a computer game or

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,880
encryption

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,880
of network communications or building

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,840
interactive social networks

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
or programming a car to drive

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,720
autonomously

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,079
so those are all examples of much more

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,159
complicated algorithms than the ones

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,200
you're probably used to

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,600
now today we're just going to look at

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,240
one

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
very simple algorithm and so the problem

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,119
that we have today

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
is one that you're probably pretty

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,920
familiar with

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,479
a building has a lift now inside the

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,640
lift

49
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,159
there are buttons to choose the floors

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,280
and outside the lift

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,280
there are buttons to call the lift

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
how should the lift choose which floor

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,479
to go to next

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,799
so that's the algorithm that we're going

55
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,399
to discuss how does the lift choose

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
which floor to move to next

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,920
given that people press buttons inside

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,479
the lift people press buttons outside

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
the lift

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,280
what's the what's the right algorithm

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,400
that the lift should use for this

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,400
okay so we find ourselves in the

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
interesting position of being chief lift

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
designer for the brand new ucl lift

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
company

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,480
and well one of the things we have to do

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,760
is to figure out what algorithm should

68
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,239
be used

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,080
now generally speaking it's probably a

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
good idea to start fairly simple

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,160
try something out and see what goes

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,280
wrong pretty reasonable strategy

73
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,640
so we make the observation that it takes

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,519
longer to go between floors that are

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
further apart

76
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
than between floors that are close

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
together and so that gives us an idea

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
a sensible optimization type algorithm

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
would be

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
to simply go to the floor that's the

81
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
nearest one selected to where the lift

82
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,319
currently is

83
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,000
that seems like a good algorithm to

84
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,760
start with so

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
we sit down and we program up our lift

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,560
algorithm it's not a very complicated

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,760
algorithm to use

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,680
and we deploy it and we wait to see what

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,560
happens

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,959
now after a little while we get a bug

91
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,959
report

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,800
hmm that's probably

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,480
not what we intended so we need to

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,200
figure out what went wrong

95
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,560
so after a little while we code up a

96
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,959
lift simulator

97
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,480
and we see so what actually happened

98
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,159
when we run this algorithm

99
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,560
and this is what we find

100
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,319
okay so what happened is that the first

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
people to arrive all wanted to go to

102
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,599
floors three and four

103
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,440
which is fine shouldn't be a problem

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,519
with that but

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,640
right after that somebody arrived on

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,120
floor one

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,879
and so floor one was the the closest

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,840
floor so the lift decided to go to floor

109
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,840
one

110
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,519
now the person who arrived at floor one

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,080
wants to go to floor four

112
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
but the lift is full so they can't get

113
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,720
in

114
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,640
so the lift door shut and the lift

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,239
departs again and goes to floor

116
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,920
two which is the nearest floor that's

117
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,840
selected now

118
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
again the lift is full so the person on

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,959
floor two who wants to go to floor one

120
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
can't get in

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,799
so the lift door's shut and they go back

122
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
to floor one because that's the nearest

123
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,959
floor that's still selected

124
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,199
and so the lift basically keeps going

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
backwards and forwards between floor one

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,479
and floor two because those floors are

127
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,199
always selected by the people waiting

128
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,199
there

129
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,720
and the poor people who are in the lift

130
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,560
never get where they're going

131
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,080
and eventually they starve to death so

132
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,160
that algorithm has a little bit of a bug

133
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,160
doesn't it um

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,440
the simplest algorithm clearly doesn't

135
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,280
work

136
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,240
now it's also pretty obvious what a

137
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,160
reasonable solution to this would be

138
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,600
the problem at the moment is the lift is

139
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,160
not paying attention

140
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,840
to what people in the lift say over what

141
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
people outside the left say and so it

142
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,400
never gets into their destination

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
so there's a pretty simple alternative

144
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,280
algorithm we can try here

145
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,039
so what we do is we'll go to the nearest

146
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
floor that's selected by people that are

147
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,720
in the lift

148
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,680
and only if nobody in the lift has

149
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
pressed a button

150
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
then we'll go to the nearest floor

151
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
that's selected by people outside the

152
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,120
lift the nearest one where a call button

153
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
is pressed

154
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
that should solve the problem we're not

155
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,280
going to have the people in the lift

156
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,000
staff to death anymore

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,759
okay so we code that up and we round to

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,479
our lift simulator with this particular

159
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
workload

160
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,160
and it works just fine and so

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,080
we deploy it to our lift and

162
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,360
see what happens people presumably going

163
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,720
to be quite happy with it

164
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,120
unfortunately the very next day we get

165
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,280
another bug report

166
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,639
hmm that's probably not what we expected

167
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
to happen

168
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
so we've clearly got another bug we're

169
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,400
going to take a little time in the lift

170
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,639
simulator to figure out what precisely

171
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,440
the workload is that causes this problem

172
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,320
but after a while we figure that out and

173
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,320
here is what happens

174
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:07,840
okay so what's happening oh

175
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,199
the users are messing up our algorithm

176
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,199
the users on floor 4 want to go to floor

177
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,880
1 and the use on floor 1 want to go to

178
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,840
floor 4 and that's fine the lift is

179
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,039
exactly what

180
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,160
it's supposed to do but unfortunately

181
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,000
our user on floor 3 is getting ignored

182
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,120
by this algorithm

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,600
um okay so we've still got a bug here

184
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,319
a diagnosis though for this is pretty

185
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
simple

186
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
um the lift shouldn't go past a floor

187
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
where

188
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
someone wants to go in the same

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,280
direction if we do that if we fix that

190
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,199
we ought to be able to fix this problem

191
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,759
so what are we going to do um

192
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,759
how about a new algorithm we'll go to

193
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,400
the nearest floor selected by somebody

194
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,479
in the lift

195
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
but we don't go past the floor where

196
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
someone wants to go in the same

197
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,120
direction as the lift

198
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,319
and if there's no one selected the

199
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,160
button in the lift at all

200
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,759
then we'll go to whatever the nearest

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,639
floor is that's selected by someone in

202
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,880
the lift

203
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,240
that surely should work i mean this will

204
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,919
definitely fix this problem

205
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,599
it will it will work won't it and so

206
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,360
we try it out on this workload and it

207
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,240
works fine on this workload and we

208
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
deploy it to

209
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,759
the real lift and

210
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,199
another day later we got another bug

211
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,960
report

212
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
well that's that's the same bug report

213
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,080
we had before but we've

214
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,919
fixed that problem well anyway we go

215
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,479
back to the lift simulator and let's see

216
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,479
what's going on

217
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,160
okay so what's happening

218
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,639
oh it's those users again they're

219
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,400
they're messing up our algorithm again

220
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,120
they just want to go from floor one to

221
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,039
floor two

222
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,080
and the lift algorithm does exactly that

223
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,960
um unfortunately it's not going as far

224
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,080
as floor 4 where we've got a user

225
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,800
so we've obviously

226
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,720
messed up again and this algorithm also

227
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
doesn't work

228
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
so what's wrong the diagnosis again is

229
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,800
pretty simple

230
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,319
if the lift's heading towards someone it

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,080
shouldn't turn around

232
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,639
and in this case the lift is turning

233
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,080
around when um

234
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,840
it gets to floor two because there's

235
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,440
more people waiting at floor one but it

236
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,520
should continue all the way up to floor

237
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,639
four

238
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,199
okay so this is going to require a new

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,399
algorithm again

240
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,599
so what are we going to do well

241
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,880
to stop it turning around we're just

242
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,240
going to make it go in one direction

243
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
until there's nobody else left to

244
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
service in that direction then

245
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,880
go back in the other direction so here's

246
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,279
our algorithm

247
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,920
we'll continue in one direction stopping

248
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,720
at floors

249
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,240
where either people outside want to go

250
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,399
in that direction

251
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
or people inside the lift want to stop

252
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,600
at that floor

253
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
okay we'll stop at either of those and

254
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,120
we'll change direction

255
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,600
only when there are no more selected

256
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,959
floors in the lift or no record buttons

257
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,560
outside the lift they'll press in that

258
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,800
direction then we can turn around and go

259
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,920
back in the other direction

260
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,600
so is that going to work well

261
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,200
tried out i live simulator and it seems

262
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,040
to work fine and

263
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,399
deployed in the real world and

264
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,839
no bug reports um

265
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,440
now it turns out that this is the actual

266
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
elevator algorithm or lift algorithm

267
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
that's used in real lift pretty much

268
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,760
everywhere in the world

269
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,279
and the interesting thing about this

270
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,279
algorithm is it's not

271
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,839
really completely obvious that this is

272
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,040
the right solution

273
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,640
um the the main thing about this

274
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
algorithm is it's really not very

275
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,399
optimal in terms

276
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,480
of the the actual median waiting time

277
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,839
but what it does is it guarantees that

278
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
nobody waits forever

279
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,040
and that's really important for an

280
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,640
algorithm like this um

281
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,640
it also turns out this algorithm is

282
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,399
what's used on computer hard disk for

283
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,760
scheduling reads from different tracks

284
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,279
on the disk it will keep

285
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,880
searching the disk head in one direction

286
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
until it reaches the end of the disk

287
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
and it will go back in the other

288
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,040
direction and so on sweeping backwards

289
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,399
and forwards across the disk and it

290
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,920
turns out it actually produces

291
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,560
not only um no starvation but also

292
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,519
pretty good mean access times for for

293
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,959
data on disks

294
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,320
as well as for people in lifts

295
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:21,200
so let's just watch it in action and

296
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,200
see how it behaves

297
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,519
it's pretty good i mean it's not

298
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,560
necessarily always the optimum algorithm

299
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,959
if under under every workload but it

300
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
really

301
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
is actually the important thing with

302
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,360
this particular algorithm

303
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,800
is is not that it gives the the best

304
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,680
median wait time

305
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,480
but that it actually is a fair algorithm

306
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
nobody ever

307
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
ends up waiting for an excessive amount

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,320
of time

309
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,120
okay so that's

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
a little bit of an introduction to

311
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,399
algorithms yeah i was taking a bit of

312
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
fun by coming up with with dumb

313
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,959
algorithms

314
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
um but they're not obviously dumb that's

315
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,399
the thing uh

316
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,680
now in terms of you can actually prove a

317
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,040
lot of things about this algorithm you

318
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,160
can prove that it's the best

319
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
algorithm in terms of

320
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,279
balancing fairness against uh

321
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
the the amount of time people actually

322
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,519
wait

323
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
now if you want a little bit of a

324
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,640
challenge

325
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,399
there are some extensions to this

326
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,600
algorithm that you might come up with

327
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,000
so the first challenge is what should

328
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
you do

329
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,160
if there's no button pressed okay

330
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,920
nothing selected

331
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,880
open effect inside lift what should the

332
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,240
lift do okay that's a

333
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,720
still got some freedom our argument

334
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,760
doesn't specify what that should do

335
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,519
and the second challenge is extend the

336
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,000
algorithm so it works efficiently to

337
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
control

338
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
two lifts rather than just one now

339
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,720
you've got

340
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,560
a little bit more complicated problem to

341
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
optimize now i'm not

342
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,519
suggesting that these are our

343
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,120
courseworks or anything you can choose

344
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,959
to do them or not if you wish

345
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
um if you put some time into thinking

346
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,160
about how they work maybe post some

347
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,440
discussion on piazza

348
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,040
and you can have a discussion there

349
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,360
about how you might extend this

350
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,880
algorithm in reasonable ways

351
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,360
okay so that's it for this week there's

352
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,160
the bomber coursework for you to

353
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,600
actually get

354
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,600
started with and so i'll see you next

355
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,839
[Music]

356
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
week

357
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:40,959
[Music]

358
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
you
